# provenance

Provenance is an interactive visualization of immigration data from 2005 - 2015, presented in room-scale VR via the HTC Vive. Each colored sphere in the space represents 10,000 people, and each color marks a different world region. The spheres that are closer to the user are from regions that are geographically closer to the United States; the further away the spheres are from the user, the greater the distance between that region and the U.S.

The purpose of this visualization is to present the grandiose and colorful nature of immigration in a way that allows users to compare and interact with the data.
