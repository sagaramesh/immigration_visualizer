# provenance

Provenance models United States immigration data from 2005-2015. Each sphere represents 10,000 people, and each world region is marked by a distinct color. The colored spheres that are closest to you are from regions that are geographically closer to the U.S. The further away the spheres, the greater the distance between the region and the U.S.
 
The purpose of this visualization is to present the colorful and grandiose nature of immigration in a way that allows users to compare and interact with the data.
